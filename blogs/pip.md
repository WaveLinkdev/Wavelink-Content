Why the heck is pip so slow

I don't dev in python but i'm trying to get a bot setup, and it is taking about 10 minutes to download a couple of libs.
I have been sitting here for so long, just waiting for it to download.
Like how can it be so slow.
Cargo is also pretty slow from what I've seen.
Nuget was pretty fast if I remember correctly, and npm is very fast.
Rant over. I have to start posting here more even if it means tiny ass blogs.
