First Entry!
============

This is going to be my blog for some time including Coding and non-coding things. I should've started this years ago when learning coding so that this blog would have been more interesting, but oh well.

Coding History
--------------

Just some basic info for the start, I believe I started when i was 12 or 11 (am 15 rn), and started with learning C# to code with Unity, because I really wanted to make my own game. It didn't go very far, with my largest project in Unity was SCP: Mental labyrinth which has been dead for about 2 years now.

In 2020 I have decided to start learning NodeJS. I didn't really code frontend Javscript by that time, so i was learning an entirley new Language, and was stepping out of my comfort zone.

Very quick I realized how much simpler it was to do thing in NodeJS, especially HTTP APIs, which at that time I was very interested in. I started grinding Node, and became in love with it.

At that time, I didn't really realize, or care about the drawbacks of a interpreted language, but as I continued realized that a compiled language would be way better, so I started looking, and Go really stood out to me. It had pretty good syntax and was compiled (Into a single binary, wow!)

I had a shot at Go, and actually kind of enjoyed it, but I never actually adpoted it, maybe sometime in the future. (I hope)

Anyways, so I continued using NodeJS and Javascript frameworks to make some fun projects, and to this day I haven't done anything for money even though I have many visions.

My history with Linux
---------------------

Fairl recently (2 Months back?) I have completley switched to using Linux, more specifically Garuda Linux, which is Arch linux with some extra tweaks and configs, so I don't have to configure it myself manually.

I have been enjoying this very much so far, and in my opinion it is way better then windows, for development atleast. For gaming, Definitley not, but only with non-steam games (By that I definitley don't mean pirated games).

I first used Ubuntu on my notebook IIRC, then put Garuda linux on my noteboox, and it was very slow :D. Today my Distros folder is massive, 38.7GB to be specific on the day of writing this. I have tried a couple, but I like arch for it's minimalist approach, and mainly pacman and the AUR.

As of now I'm pretty well versed in Linux, and hope that gaming get's better, as a couple of days ago Nvidia open-sourced their Kernel modules. While it means nothing for me, I hope that they continue on this path.

I'm gonna wrap the intro here, as it is pretty long. I'm going to study Chemistry now, test tommorow, and work on getting this svelte app done, and then I might add some entries from the recent events, seeya future me.
