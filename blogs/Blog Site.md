# Blog site

Written 2022-05-15T20:54:07.925Z

Finally looks like i managed to get this site up, it uses Svelte Kit hosted on Vercel and a Github repo that hosts all of the static content on github pages, using Github actions to build and index whenever I push a new article.

In my last entry I said i would study chemistry. I didn't, I spent time on this, so I hope it works at least. If I have time I'll try to add more entries or improve the site tomorrow, since it is quite late right now.

I'm pretty much writing this just to test how the integration works, so seeya.
