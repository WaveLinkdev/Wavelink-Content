This is going to be my blog for some time including Coding and non-coding things. I should've started this years ago when learning coding so that this blog would have been more interesting, but oh well.

## Coding History

Just some basic info for the start, I believe I started when i was 12 or 11 (am 15 rn), and started with learning C# to code with Unity, because I really wanted to make my own game. It didn't go very far, with my largest project in Unity was SCP: Mental labyrinth which has been dead for about 2 years now.

In 2020 I have decided to start learning NodeJS. I didn't really code frontend Javascript by that time, so i was learning an entirely new Language, and was stepping out of my comfort zone.

Very quick I realized how much simpler it was to do thing in NodeJS, especially HTTP APIs, which at that time I was very interested in. I started grinding Node, and became in love with it.

At that time, I didn't really realize, or care about the drawbacks of a interpreted language, but as I continued realized that a compiled language would be way better, so I started looking, and Go really stood out to me. It had pretty good syntax and was compiled (Into a single binary, wow!)

I had a shot at Go, and actually kind of enjoyed it, but I never actually adopted it, maybe sometime in the future. (I hope)

Anyways, so I continued using NodeJS and Javascript frameworks to make some fun projects, and to this day I haven't done anything for money even though I have many visions.

# My history with Linux


Fairly recently (2 Months back?) I have completely switched to using Linux, more specifically Garuda Linux, which is Arch linux with some extra tweaks and configs, so I don't have to configure it myself manually.

I have been enjoying this very much so far, and in my opinion it is way better then windows, for development at least. For gaming, Definitely not, but only with non-steam games (By that I definitely don't mean pirated games).

I first used Ubuntu on my notebook IIRC, then put Garuda linux on my notebook, and it was very slow :D. Today my Distros folder is massive, 38.7GB to be specific on the day of writing this. I have tried a couple, but I like arch for it's minimalist approach, and mainly pacman and the AUR.

As of now I'm pretty well versed in Linux, and hope that gaming get's better, as a couple of days ago Nvidia open-sourced their Kernel modules. While it means nothing for me, I hope that they continue on this path.

## End

I'm gonna wrap the intro here, as it is pretty long. I'm going to study Chemistry now, test tomorrow, and work on getting this svelte app done, and then I might add some entries from the recent events, see ya future me.
